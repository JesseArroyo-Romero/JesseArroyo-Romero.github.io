            <p>Hello, My name is Jesse Arroyo-Romero. I am 27 years old and located in Clarksville, TN. I grew up in Los Angeles, CA and then moved to Washington where I enlisted into the U.S. Army as an IT Specialist.
            I have served for five years and eight months. I was assigned to FT. Carson, CO, for three years. I served one year at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait and spent the remainder of my career at FT. Campbell, KY, until
            my service ended. I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
